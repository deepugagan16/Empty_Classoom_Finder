# EMPTY_CLASSROOM_FINDER

This web application allows students to find empty classrooms in real-time and enables teachers to book classrooms for lectures or events. The application is designed to enhance the efficient use of space within the university by providing real-time updates on room availability.

## Features
- **Classroom Finder**: Easily locate empty classrooms on campus.
- **Teacher Booking**: Teachers can log in and book classrooms for their lectures.
- **Login System**: Authentication for teachers (future version will include mandatory login for all students and teachers).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The UI is built using React and Material-UI for a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Classrooms are marked as available or booked based on real-time usage data (planned for improving the project)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing classroom data and booking information)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
- **Routing**: React Router for navigating between pages
- **State Management**: React Context API (for handling authentication and user state)

## Future Advancements
- **Mandatory Login for Students and Teachers**: Every individual will be required to log in to the application. This will allow us to keep track of the number of students present in a classroom.
- **Classroom Capacity Management**: Based on student logins, the application will monitor classroom capacity. Once a classroom reaches its full capacity, it will be automatically removed from the list of available rooms.
- **Advanced Booking System**: Teachers will have the ability to book rooms in advance and receive confirmation or reminders for their reservations.
- **Mobile App**: A mobile version of the application for easier access on the go.
